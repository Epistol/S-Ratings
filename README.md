## Build Setup
If you want to build it locally, you'll need to set your own API key into the .env file and follow theses instructions :

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
